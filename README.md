## What is Tevad.ro?

Tevad.ro is a public truth ledger for Romanian politicians. It tracks:

- **Campaign promises** — made before elections
- **Official statements & speeches** — on record, with sources
- **Voting records** — every bill, every vote, For / Against / Absent
- **Policy positions over time** — do they contradict themselves?

Each entry is AI-verified using Claude, cross-referenced with a minimum of 2 independent Tier-1 sources. Citizens can react (like / dislike) but cannot comment — the record speaks for itself.

Every politician gets a **Credibility Score** (0–100) calculated from:
- Promise kept/broken ratio
- Public reaction sentiment
- Verified source citations
- Time-in-office consistency

The score is public, the formula is public, the code is public. No hidden weights. No editorial opinion. No political affiliation.

## The Name

**"Te văd"** is Romanian for **"I see you."**

Not a threat. Not a judgment. Just a fact. The permanent, calm, undeniable presence of the public record. Politicians speak in public. Their words belong to the public. Tevad.ro just keeps them organized.

## Neutrality Rules

1. No editorial opinion — only: promised / happened / sources confirm or deny
2. All parties treated identically — same process for PSD, PNL, USR, AUR, everyone
3. Minimum 2 independent Tier-1 sources required for any FALSE verdict
4. Politicians cannot submit rebuttals through the platform
5. Credibility score is math — public formula, auditable by anyone
6. Official records (Monitorul Oficial, cdep.ro votes) always override media
7. No anonymous sources — every record must have a permanent, archived URL

## Scoring Formula

```
credibility_score = (
  score_promises * 0.35 +
  score_reactions * 0.20 +
  score_sources  * 0.25 +
  score_consistency * 0.20
) / 100
```
